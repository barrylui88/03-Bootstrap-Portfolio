# Portfolio Page for Barry Lui (rebuilt using Bootstrap)

## Description 

This webpage is my portfolio page which has been rebuilt using Bootstrap. The code has been assembled by myself but largely helped by using Bootstrap elements from the documentation of Bootstrap v4.6. It has been a great opportunity for me to apply the knowledge learned over the course of the previous weeks but also utilise a framework to enable rapid builds whilst still following best practices.

Following this task, I've massively enhanced my skills to utilise the Bootstrap framework and grown a real appreciation for the Bootstrap framework (I was particularly blown away by the Navbar component and the fact that it automatically builds a hamburger menu for you with all the buttons you have added).

The greatest challenge I had to overcome when building this page was customising the Bootstrap components. In a way, this was slightly harder than building your own components from scratch as I wasn't always sure what was customisable.
